This is a skeleton for projects using LiteEntityLib framework. 

You may need to install includes as follow:
1. Create include directory
mkdir /var/www/include

2. Get include class
cd /var/www/include
git clone git@github.com:fornve/skeleton.git

3. Get smarty and unpack it to:
/var/www/include/smarty

If you want to use different paths, you can specify them in index.php and config/config.php
